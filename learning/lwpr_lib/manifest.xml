    This package contains Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) library,
    written by Stefan Klanke, Sethu Vijayakumar, and Stefan Schaal.
    This package does not modify LWPR in any way; it simply provides a convenient
		way to download and compile the headers and library in a way that can be
		managed by the ROS dependency system.

    Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) is a recent algorithm that
    achieves nonlinear function approximation in high dimensional spaces with
    redundant and irrelevant input dimensions. At its core, it uses locally linear
    models, spanned by a small number of univariate regressions in selected
    directions in input space. A locally weighted variant of Partial Least
    Squares (PLS) is employed for doing the dimensionality reduction.
    
    This nonparametric local learning system
    * learns rapidly with second order learning methods based on incremental training,
    * uses statistically sound stochastic cross validation to learn,
    * adjusts its weighting kernels based on local information only,
    *
    * has a computational complexity that is linear in the number of inputs, and
    * can deal with a large number of - possibly redundant - inputs,

    as shown in evaluations with up to 50 dimensional data sets. To our knowledge,
    this is the first truly incremental spatially localized learning method to combine
    all these properties.

    A good reference for the algorithm is the following paper:
